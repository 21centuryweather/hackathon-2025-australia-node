# Kilometre-Scale Global Hackathon 2025

This repository includes the instructions to meet all the technical requirements to work during the Hackathon. It also includes examples on how to work with `healpy` and the helpix grid. 

### 1. Join the necesiry NCI projects

Please log in into [my.nci.org.au](https://my.nci.org.au/mancini/) and join the following projects:

* `nf33`
* `qx55` (where the km-scale simulations live)
* `xp65`
* and any other project you think you will need. For example, join `rt52` if you are going to use ERA5 data.

### 2. Clone this repository 

If you want to run the examples located in `notebooks/` clone this repository in Gadi (to be able to access the **test data**).

```
git clone git@github.com:21centuryweather/hackathon-2025-australia-node.git
```

### 3. Use the correct conda environment

A few extra package are needed to work with the healpix grid: [healpy](https://healpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [easygems.healpix](https://easy.gems.dkrz.de/Processing/index.html).  Because these packages are not available as part of the Analysis3 conda environment, we are going to use a specific environment during the hackarhon. 

Instructions on how to use it comming soon!
